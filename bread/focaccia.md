## Method

1. Sift the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer and add all the remaining dough ingredients. Knead with the dough hook on a slow speed for 8–10 minutes until smooth, soft, and elastic.

2. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, swiveling it inside the bowl until it is coated with oil on all sides. Cover with a shower cap and leave to rise at room temperature.  
   - After 45 minutes, punch the risen dough back with your fist, re-cover and leave for another 45 minutes.  
   - Punch down again and repeat a third time.  

3. Let the dough rise one last time. Cover a deep baking tray or roasting tin with measuring partchment paper.  
   - With your fingers, gently coax the dough into a flat shape to cover the tray.  
   - If the dough resists and springs back, let it relax for another 10 minutes and try again.  
   - The surface should be nicely cratered with your finger marks – this is what gives focaccia its characteristic dimpled surface.

4. Give the dough another 20 minutes to rise a final time while you preheat the oven to **200°C / gas mark 6**.  
   - Drizzle olive oil generously over the focaccia.  
   - Sprinkle on the rosemary and sea salt to taste.

5. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, use the bottom rack, then reduce the heat to **180°C / gas mark 4** and continue to bake for a further 15 minutes in the middle rack.  
   - Check that the base is golden brown and fully baked, even in the center.

6. As soon as you take the focaccia out of the oven, drizzle over more olive oil and serve immediately.
