# Ingredients

- 8g dry yeast
- 200ml cold water
- 550g strong white bread flour 100g caster sugar
- 3 eggs
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 11⁄2 tsp fine sea salt
- egg wash
- 2 tsp sesame seeds (optional)
- 2 tsp poppy seeds (optional)
- 1/2 cup grams raisins (optional)
- fine sea salt

# Instructions

1. Combine the yeast and water in the bowl of a stand mixer and stir with a fork until completely dissolved. Add the flour, sugar, eggs and olive oil. With the dough hook, mix on a low speed for 5 minutes to combine. Add the salt and increase the speed to medium for a further 8 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer and cover it with a clean, damp tea towel. Leave the dough to rise, well away from any draughts, until it has doubled in size – about 11⁄2–2 hours. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Use your hands to punch the air out of it and divide it into thirds. Take each piece in turn, and roll it back and forth to stretch it into a long thin roll about 50cm long.
2. Now you’re ready to braid. Take your three logs and press them together at the end furthest away from you, with the central strand pointing directly towards you and the other two roughly at 90° from each other. Cross the right strand over the central one, laying it gently in the space between the central log and the left strand. What was on the right is now in the centre. Lift the left strand over the central log, placing it in the space between the central and right logs. Repeat until the braid is complete.
3. Line a baking sheet with baking paper and carefully transfer the cholla onto it. Slip the whole thing into a large plastic bag. Inflate the bag so that the dough doesn’t come into contact with the plastic. Leave to prove again for 11⁄2–2 hours, depending on the temperature of your kitchen. The loaf should be visibly larger, though not doubled in size.
4. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6. Lightly brush the top of the loaf with egg wash, making sure it goes into every fold and crevice. Sprinkle the seeds on top and place in the centre of the oven. Immediately reduce the heat to 180°C/gas mark 4 and bake for 40–45 minutes. Halfway through baking, rotate the baking sheet from front to back to ensure an
even bake. The finished cholla should be a glossy, chestnut brown. Cool on the tray for 10–15 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
