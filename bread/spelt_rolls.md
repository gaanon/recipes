# Ingredients

- 225g spelt flour
- 5g yeast
- 15g honey
- 50ml warm (38c) water
- 100ml cold water
- 1 tsp salt
- ice cubes

# Instructions

1. Combine the flour, yeast, honey or sugar and the water into the bowl of a stand mixer, and knead with the dough hook for 7 minutes at low speed.
2. Add the salt and knead for 3 minutes. Remove the bowl, cover with a clean, damp tea towel, and allow the dough to rise for 11⁄2–2 hours at room temperature until almost doubled in size.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it into a log shape. Using a sharp knife or a dough scraper, divide the log into 16 rolls, each weighing around 40–45g. Shape them into little balls (see here for how to form rolls).
4. Line a baking sheet with baking paper and dust with flour, then place the rolls on it and place the whole thing inside a large plastic bag, inflated so that it won’t come into contact with the dough. Allow to rise once more at room temperature, for 11⁄2–2 hours, until doubled in size.
5. When they are nearly ready, place a baking stone or another baking sheet in the oven and heat the oven to 200°C (no fan). Place a smaller baking tin on the oven floor to act as a water vessel.
6. Dust the rolls with a little more flour and make a snip halfway through the middle of each one with a sharp pair of scissors. Before putting the rolls in the oven, tip the ice cubes into the pan on the bottom. (This will help to form a better crust.)
7. Quickly take the baking stone out of the oven and in one swift motion, slide the baking paper with the rolls on it onto the hot stone. Place the rolls in the centre of the oven and bake for 13–15 minutes until the bottom of the rolls are golden brown. They should open up like little tulips as they bake.
8. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 10–15 minutes.
