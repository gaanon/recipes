### Instructions
1. **Preheat the grill** to medium.  
   Put the cauliflower florets and red onion slices into a roasting tin.  
   Season, then rub 1 tbsp of the oil into the vegetables. Spread out in a single layer and grill for 10 minutes, turning halfway, or until charred.  

2. **Meanwhile**, in a bowl, use a fork to whisk together the cornflour, vinegar, Shaoxing rice wine, both soy sauces, and 75ml water until smooth. Set aside.  

3. **Cook the noodles:**  
   Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and cook the noodles according to the packet instructions. Drain, rinse under cold water, then divide between 4 bowls.  

4. **Prepare the sauce:**  
   Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan over high heat. Add the garlic and fry for 1 minute, then add the chilli flakes and cashews. Fry for another minute.  

5. **Combine:**  
   Reduce the heat to medium, then pour over the sauce. Simmer for 2â€“3 minutes until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  

6. **Finish:**  
   When the cauliflower and onion are cooked, spoon straight into the sauce and toss everything together. Serve over the noodles.
