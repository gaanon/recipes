# Dough

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 3/4 cup warm water , plus 1 tbsp water
- 1 tsp neutral oil

## Instructions

1. Add in the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Mix.
2. Create a well in the center of the bowl and pour in the warm water.
3. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to mix the flour and water. Once the dough starts to come together, add in 1 tsp of oil.
4. Use your hands to mix the bits of dough. You can also use a stand mixer if you have one. Knead together for several minutes. If the dough is a bit dry, add a splash of water.
5. Keep kneading until you have a smooth ball of dough.
6. Shape the dough into a ball, then place it in a bowl.
7. Cover it with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.

# Making the wrappers

1. Add some flour on your work surface. Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it a few times.
2. Punch hole in the middle of the dough and then create a donut shape. Slowly stretch.
3. Slice the dough into 8 pieces. Roll or shape each piece of dough into a ball. Cover the dough with a towel to prevent from drying while you work on one at a time.
4. To make a wrapper, press down on the ball of dough and lightly flatten it over the surface. Sprinkle a little flour on top and lightly coat your rolling pin with some flour as well.
5. While holding both ends of the rolling pin, roll out the dough by moving the pin forward and backward. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and repeat the movement.
6. Continue to roll out the dough until you have a wrapper that’s around 5-5 ½ inches in diameter. If you can’t make them into a perfectly round shape, that’s okay! Mine weren’t perfect but I was still able to properly fold these together. It really takes some time and practice to get a hang of making wrappers.
7. Place the rolled out wrappers on a tray and cover with a dry towel to prevent them from drying out. Roll out the rest of the dough.
8. Take a rolled out piece of wrapper and place around 1/3-1/2 cup of filling into the center.
9. Crease the edges and pinch with your fingers. Twist to seal and then carefully press it down to flatten. See video for a visual guide. Afterwards, place back the pancake on the tray and cover with a dry towel to prevent it from drying out. Repeat for the rest of the wrappers.

# Cooking the pancakes

1. Heat a pan (with a lid), add in 1 tbsp of oil (for every 2 pancakes). When hot, add in the pancakes and lightly press down. Leave to cook over medium heat for 4-5 minutes until it has a golden brown crust. Flip over and leave to cook for another 4-5 until golden brown.
2. Prepare the lid of your pan. Using the lid as protection, carefully pour 2 tbsp of water (1 tbsp for each pancake) into the pan and then immediately cover to prevent it from splashing due to the heat. (I had mixed results doing this, the pancake will be soggy)
3. Leave to cook in the steam, until the water has evaporated, around 5-6 minutes. Take out the pies and repeat this step for the remaining ones. Enjoy while hot! See storage tips in the notes below.
