# Ingredients

- 450 g potatoes 
- 40 g unsalted butter
- 30 g all-purpose flour
- 50 g granulated sugar
- 1 handful dried mushrooms e.g. porcini mushrooms
- 180 ml heavy cream fat content about 30 %
- 3 Tablespoon vinegar 5% acidity
- 3 Tablespoons fresh dill chopped, only leaves, no stems
- 720 ml vegetable broth lukewarm, for soup
- 480 ml water to cook dried mushrooms
- salt
- 0.25 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 medium hard-boiled eggs

# Instructions

1. Place dried mushrooms in a pot with 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then set aside.
2. Make a roux to thicken the kulajda soup: In a thick-bottomed pot, melt unsalted butter over medium heat. Add all-purpose flour and stir for 1 minute, until it creates a bubbling mass.
3. Start adding vegetable broth in batches: begin with ½ cup, stirring well. Continue adding the broth in small increments, stirring thoroughly each time, until all the broth is incorporated. This method will help prevent lumps in the soup.
4. Add the mushroom broth to the soup, straining out the cooked mushrooms. Season with salt and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a minimum. Cover with a lid and let it cook for 10 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into ½-inch cubes. Add them to the soup along with the cooked mushrooms and cook for another 15 minutes, or until the potato cubes have softened.
6. Chop the fresh dill, using only the soft green leaves and avoiding the stems.
7. Remove the soup from the stove, then pour in the cream and stir. Add vinegar, sugar, ground pepper, and chopped dill. Do not cook any further. Mix everything together with a wooden spoon, and season to your liking with salt and/or sugar if necessary.
8. Let the kulajda soup sit for 5 minutes before serving.
