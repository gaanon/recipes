# Ingredients

- 30g unsalted butter
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- Zest and juice 3 lemons (ideally Sicilian), plus wedges to serve
- 50g ’nduja, crumbled
- Bunch fresh flatleaf parsley, chopped
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for frying
- 50g fresh white breadcrumbs
- 400g fresh pappardelle
- 40g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve

# Instructions

1. Heat the butter in a large pan over a low heat and fry the shallots for 15 minutes until soft. Add the garlic, lemon zest and juice, then cook for a minute. Add the ’nduja and half the parsley, then fry for 1-2 minutes.
2. In a small frying pan, heat a glug of olive oil, add the breadcrumbs and fry over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes until crisp. Set aside.
3. Cook the pappardelle in a pan of boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes until almost tender. Drain, reserving a cupful of the cooking water, then add the pasta to the ’nduja mixture. Set over a medium heat, then toss with a splash of the pasta water, the 3 tbsp olive oil and the 40g parmesan.
4. Season to taste, divide among bowls, sprinkle with the crunchy breadcrumbs and remaining parsley, then serve with lemon wedges and extra parmesan.
